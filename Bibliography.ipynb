    "abstract = {Defining structure and detecting the emergence of complexity in nature are inherently subjective, though essential, scientific activities. Despite the difficulties, these problems can be analyzed in terms of how model-building observers infer from measurements the computational capabilities embedded in nonlinear processes. An observer’s notion of what is ordered, what is random, and what is complex in its environment depends directly on its computational resources: the amount of raw measurement data, of memory, and of time available for estimation and inference. The discovery of structure in an environment depends more critically and subtlely, though, on how those resources are organized. The descriptive power of the observer’s chosen (or implicit) computational model class, for example, can be an overwhelming determinant in finding regularity in data. This paper presents an overview of an inductive framework — hierarchical -machine reconstruction — in which the emergence of complexity is associated with the innovation of new computational model classes. Complexity metrics for detecting structure and quantifying emergence, along with an analysis of the constraints on the dynamics of innovation, are outlined. Illustrative examples are drawn from the onset of unpredictability in nonlinear systems, finitary nondeterministic processes, and cellular automata pattern recognition. They demonstrate how finite inference resources drive the innovation of new structures and so lead to the emergence of complexity.},\n",

Using the fractal analysis, and the box-counting method (BCM) in particular, it is possible to characterize the spatial distribution of the prime AE sources through the fractal dimension (D) that evolve with the number of fatigue cycles (N) of the specimen. D-N curves were found useful to identify the condition of incipient collapse due to the nucleation and propagation of fatigue cracks on steel. It is possible to use the fractal dimension as a damage parameter. In all tested specimens, the crisis occurs within the same range of values of fractal dimension.

    "abstract = {Pursuit of sustainable development requires a systems approach to the design of industrial product and service systems. Although many business enterprises have adopted sustainability goals, the actual development of sustainable systems remains challenging because of the broad range of economic, environmental and social factors that need to be considered across the system life cycle. Traditional systems engineering practices try to anticipate and resist disruptions but may be vulnerable to unforeseen factors. An alternative is to design systems with inherent \"resilience\" bytaking advantage of fundamental properties such as diversity, efficiency, adaptability, and cohesion. Previous work on sustainable design has focused largely upon ecological efficiency improvements. For example, companies have found that reducing material and energy intensity and converting wastes into valuable secondary products creates value for shareholders as well as for society at large. To encourage broader systems thinking, a design protocol is presented that involves the following steps: identifying system function and boundaries, establishing requirements, selecting appropriate technologies, developing a system design, evaluating anticipated performance, and devising a practical means for system deployment. The approach encourages explicit consideration of resilience in both engineered systems and the larger systems in which they are embedded.},\n",

These nuances can result in confusion and misinterpretations of goals and results, hampering com- munication and complicating collaboration. In this paper, we propose security-related definitions for these terms. Us- ing this terminology, we argue that research in these areas must consider the functionality of the system holistically, beginning with a careful examination of what we actually want the system to do. We note that much of the published research focuses on a single aspect of a system – availability – as opposed to the system’s ability to complete its function without disclosing confidential information or, to a lesser extent, with the correct output. Finally, we discuss ways in which researchers can explore resilience with respect to integrity, availability and confidentiality.},\n",

Specifically, the five brittle and ductile fracture modes are studied, from three well characterized steels (a mild steel, a low-alloy steel and a 32 wt\\% Mn-steel) where the salient microstructural dimensions contributing to the final fracture morphology have been measured. Resulting plots of the mean angular deviation, and Richardson (fractal) plots of the lineal roughness, as a function of the measuring step size, are interpreted with the aid of computer-simulated fracture-surface profiles with known characteristics. It is found that the ranges of resolution, over which the fractal dimension is constant, correspond to the pertinent metallurgical dimensions on the fracture surface, and thus can be related to microstructural size-scales.},\n",

    "abstract = { Product sustainment means keeping an existing system operational and maintaining the ability to continue to manufacture and field versions of the system that satisfy the original requirements. Sustainment also includes manufacturing and fielding revised versions of the system that satisfy evolving requirements, which often requires the replacement of technologies used to construct the original system with newer technologies. Technology insertion involves determining which technologies to replace during a design refresh, i.e., deciding the design refresh content, and deciding when that design refresh should take place. Technology replacement decisions are driven by a broad range of issues including performance, reliability, environmental impact, cost, and logistics, and when, or if other design refreshes will take place. Traditional \"value\" metrics go part of the way toward providing a coupled view of performance, reliability and cost, but are generally ignorant of how product sustainment may be impacted. A metric that measures both the value of the technology refreshment and insertion, and its ability to support both the system's current and future affordability and capability needs including hardware, software, information and intellectual property is required. This paper discusses a concept called viability. Viability is a measure of the producibility, supportability, and evolvability of a system and can serve as a metric for assessing technology insertion opportunities.},\n",

    "abstract = {Many real world optimization problems involve uncertainties. A solution for such a problem is expected to be robust to these uncertainties. Commonly, robustness is attained by choosing the solution’s parameters such that the solution’s performance is less influenced by negative effects of the uncertain parameters’ variations. This robustness may be viewed as a passive robustness, because once the solution’s parameters are chosen, the robustness is inherent in the solution and no further action, to suppress the effect of uncertainties, is expected. However, it is acknowledged that enhanced robustness comes on the expense of peak performances. In this study, Active Robust Optimization is presented as a new robust optimization approach. It considers products that are able to adapt to environmental changes. The enhanced robustness of these solutions is attained by adaptation, which reduces the loss in performance due to environmental changes. A new optimization problem named Active Robust Optimization Problem is formulated. The problem amalgamates robust optimization with dynamic optimization in order to evaluate the performance of a candidate solution, while considering possible environmental conditions. Adaptation’s influence on the solution’s performance and cost is considered as well. Hence, the problem is formulated as a multiobjective problem that simultaneously aims at low costs and high performance. Since these goals are commonly in conflict: the solution is a set of optimal adaptive solutions. An evolutionary algorithm is proposed in order to evolve this set. An example of optimizing an adaptive optical table is provided. It is shown that an adaptive product, which is an outcome of the suggested approach, may be superior to an equivalent product that is not adaptive.},\n",

The structure of stress and strain singularity at the tip of a fractal crack, which can be self-similar or self-affine, is studied. The three classical modes of fracture and the fourth mode of fracture are discussed for fractal cracks in twodimensional and three- dimensional solid bodies. It is discovered that there are six modes of fracture in fractal fracture mechanics. The J -integral is shown to be path-dependent. It is explained that the proposed modified J - integrals in the literature that are argued to be path-independent are only locally path-independent and have no physical meaning. It is conjectured that a fractal J -integral should be the rate of potential energy release per unit of a fractal measure of crack growth. The powers of stress and strain singularities at the tip of a fractal crack in a strain-hardening material are calculated. It is shown that stresses and strains have weaker singularities at the tip of a fractal crack than they do at the tip of a smooth crack.},\n",

The underlying processes and physical components of a specific service delivery (e.g. electric power or water) reveal many dependencies both technical and non technical. The paper presents an integrated methodology for vulnerability and resilience analysis for underground infrastructures, i.e. a societal risk analysis of the failures of underground services for an urban area. Based on the use of a hybrid approach, the proposed methodology breaks down the area under analysis into sub-areas and assesses the dependencies among sub-areas both in terms of interoperability, damage propagation of critical infrastructures and target zoned-description. The methodology demonstrates clear advantage in terms of resilience analysis, more consistent with the “zoned” nature of failures of the underground infrastructures. A case study, dealing with the interoperability and damage propagation analysis of the underground infrastructures of a Northern Italy town, will be presented for this purpose. A resilience analysis of the “system of systems” (i.e. multiple underground infrastructures) can be performed through the proposed methodology, evaluating the internal characteristics of the system able to mitigate or amplify the impact of local failures and thus the capability to assure service continuity after such failures. Finally a strategy for risk mitigation is proposed in order to maintain the minimum level of service.},\n",

However, the few existing frameworks have drawbacks, such as not analyzing the sources of resilience (SRs) and the sources of brittleness (SBs) side-by-side. Moreover, they limit themselves to investigating resilience in pre-determined units of analysis (e.g., teams), neglecting the fact that resilience might be in any element of a socio-technical system. This article introduces a framework for identifying and analyzing SRs and SBs jointly, which do not constrain the identification process to any specific unit of analysis within the investigated system. The sources should be identified and analyzed across five categories: the opposite SR or SB; the risk from the SB; the effectiveness of the SR; those originating from either internal processes or the external environment; those arising from formal or informal practices. A case study of two air taxi carriers illustrates the application of the framework. Relevance to industry: Resilience engineering (RE) is an emerging safety management paradigm concerned with normal work, rather than emphasizing learning from incidents. The proposed framework allows the identification and analysis of the most salient sources of resilience and brittleness. It can be applied for investigating resilience at any unit of analysis within a socio-technical system, supporting the identification of strengths and weaknesses from the RE perspective. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},\n",

That understanding is essential to the development of information and communications technology (ICT) that are intended to support operator performance. While crises are uncommon in other high hazard sectors such as nuclear power generation and aviation, acute and ambulatory healthcare work encounters life-and-death crises daily. This makes healthcare a useful living laboratory to develop ICT in order to manage crises. This paper shows how healthcare organizations that continually deal with complex, uncertain, high-tempo operations can serve as a model to develop ICT that supports crisis management. We illustrate the results of using these methods through an example of cognitive systems engineering research that identifies ambulatory care risks to patients. We then describe multiple methods that can be used together to efficiently study complex, high hazard work settings. We conclude with an example of how it can support the development of a cognitive aid for diabetic care to support work in that setting.},\n",

The conflicts arise over the relative importance of various goals. Normally, such disagreements are fought out in the contexts of specific decisions, and so are fought out over and over again, at enormous social cost each time another decision must be made. This paper proposes a method that can spell out explicitly what each individual's or group's values are, showing how and how much they differ-and in the process can frequently reduce the extent of such differences. It presents data illustrating the application of this technology, multiattribute utility measurement, to two specific instances: management of the coastal zone of the town of Venice, a part of Los Angeles, CA; and selection of research programs for the Office of Child Development, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. In both cases, exploitation of multiattribute utility measurement permits the decisionmaking or regulatory agencies to shift their attention from the specific actions, being regulated to the values these actions serve and the decisionmaking mechanisms that implement these values. In the process, the data show that degree of disagreement about values among holders of conflicting value systems are often reduced.},\n",

In particular, several experimental campaigns have shown a decrease of the material strength under static or fatigue loading with increasing structural size, and some theoretical arguments have been proposed to interpret such a phenomenon. As far as fatigue crack growth is concerned, limited information on size effect is available in the literature. In the present paper, by exploiting some concepts of fractal geometry, new definitions of fracture energy and stress intensity factor based on physical dimensions different from the classical ones are discussed. Then, a size-dependent crack growth law (expressing crack growth rate against stress intensity factor range) is proposed.

Based upon a safety managerial trend aiming to diffuse safety culture through training within a pharmaceutical industry, analysis are initiated to define how organizational resilience (attached to safety culture) interweaves with risk factors and can be developed through training. Classical safety management aims at developing various systems, technical as well as organizational, to prevent and protect against dangers. Training, in this case, is a matter of risk assessment development. We suggest a new perspective stemming from human management. Its axis is to identify the frame of psychological resilience and to consider how it can be sustained. Psychological resilience appears to be a three-dimensional phenomenon less linked to risk assessment than to cultural structuralism and systemic adaptation. Along with the discussion, the question of training towards psychological resilience is discussed as well. It appears that resilience is questioned by uncertainty, ambiguity and complexity, and framed by structural, symbolic and relational systems; risk factors awareness, prudence and justice standards, along with systemic adaptation, altogether can sustain flexible and adaptative responses.},\n",

Interdependency between SoS systems, while enabling new capability, also means that failures can cascade throughout the SoS, creating development delays or additional system failures. Here we develop a method based on Bayesian networks to evaluate the resilience of SoS design alternatives to failures during operations. We propose a conditional resilience metric that measures each constituent system's contribution to overall SoS resilience, and a resilience pattern that shows how SoS performance degrades as systems fail. SoS resilience is determined by both the SoS architecture and the constituent system reliability. In a simple example based on the Littoral Combat Ship SoS, we determine the two most critical systems using the conditional resilience metric. Adding a communications link between these two systems increases the resilience, resulting in higher expected performance and slower expected performance degradation as a result of system failure. The conditional resilience and resilience pattern can be used by designers and other decision makers to identify SoS architectures and systems that increase SoS resilience to failure.},\n",

This article presents a new Supply Chain Resilience Framework to help businesses deal with change. The conceptual framework is based on extant literature and refined through a focus group methodology. Our findings suggest that supply chain resilience can be assessed in terms of two dimensions: vulnerabilities and capabilities. The Zone of Resilience is defined as the desired balance between vulnerabilities and capabilities, where it is proposed that firms will be the most profitable in the long term. We identified seven vulnerability factors composed of 40 specific attributes and 14 capability factors from 71 attributes that facilitate the measurement of resilience.

If the decision can be delayed, the expected overage and underage costs can be reduced. We model the effects of a delay of the final purchase under various scenarios of remaining demand. We contrast the manufacturing benefits with the costs incurred by the supplier and show that the supplier, who benefits greatly from the end-of-life buy, likely will require an incentive to enact a delay.

    "abstract = {Many technologies have life cycles that are shorter than the life cycle of the product or system they are in. Life cycle mismatches caused by the obsolescence of technology can result in large life cycle costs for long field life systems, such as aircraft, ships, communications infrastructure, power plant and grid management, and military systems. This paper addresses Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Materials Shortages (DMSMS) obsolescence, which is defined as the loss of the ability to procure a technology or part from its original manufacturer. Forecasting when technologies and specific parts will become unavailable (non-procurable) is a key enabler for pro-active DMSMS management and strategic life cycle planning for long field life systems. This paper presents a methodology for generating algorithms that can be used to predict the obsolescence dates for electronic parts that do not have clear evolutionary parametric drivers. The method is based on the calculation of procurement lifetime using databases of previous obsolescence events and introduced parts that have not gone obsolete. The methodology has been demonstrated on a range of different electronic parts and for the trending of specific part attributes. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},\n",

An alternative account of planning in both the public and private sectors is offered in the transaction cost theory of planning. Extending economic transaction cost theory into the public and the interorganizational domains suggests that both economic and political markets do not need planning, since planning is associated with nonmarket hierarchical forms of organization and organizational systems. The transaction cost theory of planning accounts for planning in the public and private sectors alike and offers a link between planning, coordination, and implementation. Perhaps it also raises questions that may stimulate exploration of the relation between organizational and interorganizational structures and planning processes.},\n",

It is not something a system has, but rather something a system does, or even more specifically, the way in which a system does what it does. Because resilient behaviour (or lack thereof) is manifested over time, the dynamics of resilience are of interest. Studies of resilience to date have been largely descriptive, but understanding of how resilient performance comes about, and especially how we might enhance it, or recognize that a system is losing it, has been difficult. This work uses system dynamics models to develop inductively a theory of activities resulting in resilient performance in complex systems, and to elaborate on previous representations of system resilience. Such models might be useful in two ways: explaining how resilient behaviours observed might come about; and exploring the temporal dynamics of changes in state (for example, suggesting leading rather than lagging indicators of performance).},\n",

As part of the ESARR framework, quantitative safety assessment of a planned system change needs to be conducted, which addresses technological, procedural and human contributions to safety performance. However, the power of quantitative risk assessment is depending on the power of the risk assessment methods used. Regarding Human reliability often old fashioned method are used which predetermine misleading safety improvements as they result from a systematical mis-assessment of the human contribution to risk and safety. The resilience principles are used to define a better approach to Human Reliability Assessment (HRA).

    "abstract = {All mechanical designs pass through a series of formal and informal redesign steps, involving the analysis of functionality, manufacturability, cost and other life-cycle factors. The speed and efficacy of these steps has a major influence on the lead time of the product from conceptualization to launching. In this paper we propose a methodology for automatically generating redesign suggestions for reducing setup costs for machined parts. Given an interpretation of the design as a collection of machinable features, our approach is to generate alternate machining features by making geometric changes to the original features, and add them to the feature set of the original part to create an extended feature set. The designer may provide restrictions on the design indicating the type and extent of modifications allowed on certain faces and volumes, in which case all redesign suggestions generated by our approach honour those restrictions. By taking combinations of features from the extended feature set generated above, we can generate modified versions of the original design that still satisfy the designer's intent. By considering precedence constraints, we can estimate the setup time that will be required for each design. Any modified design whose setup time is less than that of the original design can be presented to the designer as a possible way to modify the original design.

There are many such descriptions of resilience within and across different domains. Comparison and generalisation is difficult because resilience is not a component of a system and should be understood as an emergent property. Here we provide a framework for reasoning about resilience that requires representation of the level of analysis (from the individual to operational), a traceable link from abstract theory to specific observations, resilience mechanisms, and contextual factors. This moves forward an agenda to systematically observe concrete manifestations of resilience within and across domains. We illustrate the application of the framework by considering a case study of the performance of nuclear power plant (NPP) operators in an experimental scenario. This paper focuses on the small team level of analysis. The framework presented here provides the basis for developing concrete measures for improving the resilience of organisations through training, system design, and organisational learning. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},\n",

It is important to see the distinction between recommendations from accident investigations that aim at maintaining the ability to respond to known disturbances, (stability) and recommendations aimed at increasing the ability to cope with irregular and unexampled events (resilience). Instead of attempting to maximize resilience and stability at the same time, it may be more fruitful to try to balance these properties of a system.

We then present new results concerning different problems that arise in a financial context: (a) the generalisation of the MP result to the case of an empirical correlation matrix (ECM) constructed using exponential moving averages, for which we give a new elegant derivation (b) the specific dynamics of the `market' eigenvalue and its associated eigenvector, which defines an interesting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on the unit sphere and (c) the problem of the dependence of ECM's on the observation frequency of the returns and its interpretation in terms of lagged cross-influences.},\n",

    "abstract = {In this paper, the usability of fractal description of dendrites in failure analysis is discussed. Dendrites grow during electrochemical migration (ECM) causing failures in the form of short circuits between conductive wirings and leads in microcircuit interconnection and packaging elements, especially on printed wiring boards (PWBs). The parameters of the dendrite growth process are influenced by functional (electrical) and environmental conditions as well as by the material composition of metallization stripes and surface finishes. Mathematically, dendrites can be described as fractals and therefore they can be characterized with fractal dimension values calculated by various computerized pattern processing methods. We have found relationship between chemical composition of surface finishes and fractal dimensions of dendrites grown from them. This hypothesis has been proved in three steps: first, dendrites were grown by simple water drop test (WDT) series in order to get good quality, reproducible test specimens; in the second step, optical photomicrographs were taken from the dendrite structures and finally these micrographs were analyzed using computerized algorithms. The result is that fractal dimensions are material specific and so they can be used to describe the material composition. This is not only an important theoretical result in understanding dendrite growth mechanisms, but it also has a useful practical aspect: short detection and optical inspection can be combined with simple calculations to identify materials involved into electrochemical migration failures without making more complicated elemental chemical analysis. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

    "abstract = {Ecosystem restoration is fast becoming the third major strategy of the modern environmental era, which began in the 1960s by seeking to mitigate the effects of conventional, exploitation-dominated resource management and then, in the 1970s, turned to pollution prevention and preservation of wildlife, recreational opportunities, and other multiple uses.1 The goals of recent restoration plans are anything but simple. Those who seek to restore any ecosystem must deal with two separate problems. The first is a social problem, which is an attempt to define goals and objectives, or to develop a collective sense of what society wants. Closely tied to that articulation of \"what we want\" is the complex array of pre-existing and emerging social structures- laws, policies, and institutions that frame the options for achieving a vision of restoration. The second problem is scientific, in which experts attempt to lay out a range of ecological trajectories, structures (such as biological diversity), and functions that define possible restoration outcomes. Almost invariably, the first problem (what do we want?) overshadows the second problem (what can we get?) in implementation. As a result, both goals become difficult if not impossible to attain and, over time, both ecological and social restoration aspirations fail. A key challenge for designers and managers of restoration plans is to recognize the interplay between, and constraints imposed by, both the sociopolitical and biophysical worlds. By weaving ecological principles and legal analysis together, we hope to shed light on the successes and failures of two landmark restoration projects: the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River and the Florida Everglades. These projects share common goals-to restore degraded habitat and to maintain water supplies. They also share a common problem-making meaningful progress towards restoration goals. In the Grand Canyon, modest successes have been achieved through an adaptive management program that attempts to blend the social and ecological objectives. In the Everglades, however, the restoration approach has separated the ecological from the social, legal, and political domains, and as a result has accomplished very little.2 The successes and failures of these experiments in ecosystem restoration are a result of many factors. In this Article, we focus on three elemental ingredients. The first is the emerging system property of resilience, a concept that describes a more complex model of change and restoration than typical resource management goals related to maximizing social uses and achieving optimum yields of resource outputs. Resilience is a characteristic of both social and ecological systems. Resilience theory suggests that complex systems can exist in fundamentally different regimes, and resilience is the property that mediates transitions among those regimes. Hence resilience must be overcome when undertaking objectives that involve regime changes, such as an ecological restoration or a social transformation. In fact, a comparative analysis of the Grand Canyon and Everglades projects reveals that resilience may not always be a good thing, particularly when it exhibits itself as entrenched stakeholder interests or institutions that do not embrace change. A second significant factor in achieving restoration goals is legislation and other legal requirements, which can either enable or constrain ecosystem restoration. The Grand Canyon Protection Act of 19923 and the Everglades restoration provisions of the Water Resources Development Act of 20004 specifically authorize restoration. At the same time, existing, generally applicable legislation, such as the Clean Water Act5 and the Endangered Species Act,6 remains in play and adds to the complexities of ecosystem restoration. The third factor involves the administration of legislation through agencies' initiatives and public participation, particularly stakeholder involvement. Whether combative, collaborative, or somewhere in between, the participants' commitment to experimentation and adaptation in the implementation of a restoration plan has a profound influence on the speed and trajectory of restoration. The remainder of this Article is structured as follows. Part II discusses the concept of resilience and how it underpins notions of restoration and sustainability. National legislative goals and requirements related to these concepts are then described. Next, Part III takes a close look at the physical characteristics and specific legislative directives for the Everglades and the Grand Canyon. Part IV sets forth several \"lessons learned\" from these two restoration projects. Finally, Part V concludes with broader observations about restoration and resilience. Success is not possible, and failure may be inevitable, unless the science of ecology, environmental law, and public administration are calibrated to foster experimentation, learning, and adaptation in management strategies.},\n",

    "abstract = {BACKGROUND: The vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), however, evidence remains conflicting. A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate this association. METHODS: We searched Pubmed, Medline and Embase databases for case-control studies evaluating the association between the VDR Apa-I, Bsm-I, Fok-I, Taq-I polymorphisms and MS risk. Data were extracted using standardized forms and odds ratios (OR) with 95\\% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: 11 case-control studies involving a total of 2599 cases and 2816 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Available data did not suggest an association between any of the VDR polymorphisms and the risk for MS. For Taq-I, which is the most investigated VDR polymorphism with 8 studies (2472 cases and 2446 controls), the combined OR was 1.12 (95\\% CI: 1.00-1.26) for the dominant model (tt+Tt vs. TT), 1.03(95\\% CI: 0.88-1.20) for the recessive model (tt vs. Tt+TT), and 1.04 (95\\% CI: 0.78-1.38) for the homozygote model (tt vs. TT). ORs for other VDR polymorphisms were similar. CONCLUSION: The VDR Apa-I, Bsm-I, Fok-I and Taq-I polymorphisms are not associated with MS risk.},\n",

To aid in evaluating the dynamic behaviour of such systems we need to establish clearly elucidated performance criteria that encapsulate the attributes of resilience. A literature review establishes the latter as readiness, responsiveness and recovery. We also identify robustness as a necessary condition that would complement resilience. We find that the Integral of the Time Absolute Error (ITAE) is an appropriate control engineering measure of resilience when it is applied to inventory levels and shipment rates. We use the ITAE to evaluate an often used benchmark model of make-to-stock supply chains consisting of three decision parameters. We use both linear and nonlinear forms of the model in our evaluation. Our findings suggest that optimum solutions for resilience do not yield a system that is robust to uncertainties in lead-time. Hence supply chains will experience drastic changes in their resilience performance when lead-time changes.},\n",

Next, I exploit the connection between robust control and uncertainty aversion to present and interpret my results in terms of the distorted beliefs held by the central bank, households, and firms. My main results are as follows. First, the central bank's pessimism leads it to forecast future outcomes using an expectations operator that, relative to rational expectations, assigns greater probability to extreme inflation and consumption outcomes. Second, the central bank's skepticism about its model causes it to move forcefully to stabilize inflation following shocks. Finally, even in the absence of misspecification, policy loss can be improved if the central bank implements a robust policy.},\n",

We first review some early results in that field, with particular emphasis on the applications of correlation cleaning to portfolio optimisation, and discuss the extension of the Marcenko-Pastur (MP) distribution to a non trivial `true' underlying correlation matrix. We then present new results concerning different problems that arise in a financial context: (a) the generalisation of the MP result to the case of an empirical correlation matrix (ECM) constructed using exponential moving averages, for which we give a new elegant derivation (b) the specific dynamics of the `market' eigenvalue and its associated eigenvector, which defines an interesting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on the unit sphere and (c) the problem of the dependence of ECM's on the observation frequency of the returns and its interpretation in terms of lagged cross-influences.},\n",

The dominant research tradi tion on adaptation to environmental change primarily takes an actor-centered view, focusing on the agency of social actors to respond to specific environmental stimuli and emphasizing the reduction of vulnerabilities. The resilience approach is systems orientated, takes a more dynamic view, and sees adaptive capacity as a core feature of resilient social-ecological systems. The two approaches converge in identifying necessary components of adaptation. We argue that resilience provides a useful framework to analyze adaptation processes and to identify appropriate policy responses. We distinguish between incremental adjustments and transformative action and demonstrate that the sources of resilience for taking adaptive action are common across scales. These are the inherent system characteristics that absorb perturbations without losing function, networks and social capital that allow autonomous action, and resources that promote institutional learning},\n",

Such pitfalls include double counting, ignoring post-disaster liabilities, ignoring non-market losses (e.g. recreation, loss of leisure, damage to historic sites and cultural assets, etc.), ignoring the needs of the end user, and questions as to how indirect/systemic losses might be modeled. With one exception, much of what is discussed in the paper is based on off-the-shelf economics and will not prove to be contentious. Regional economists are likely to have different opinions as to how to best model indirect and systemic loss; it is this that will lead to a lively debate as to how to proceed.

It is interesting to note that the concepts as discussed in the collective book on resilience engineering (Hollnagel, Woods \\& Leveson, 20061) share some similarities with the methodological and theoretical developments found in the child resilience field. Three examples of these similarities are discussed here. First we discuss the cross disciplinary nature of the child and organisational resilience.

Its importance and complexity are being increasingly recognized in disaster risk reduction research and practice. This paper provides an overview of current research on economic recovery and suggests a research agenda to address key gaps in knowledge. Empirical studies have provided a number of robust findings on the disaster recovery of businesses and local economies, with particular insights into short- and long-term recovery patterns, influential factors in recovery, and disparities in recovery across types of businesses and economies. Modeling studies have undertaken formal analyses of economic impacts of disasters in which recovery is usually addressed through the incorporation of resilience actions and investments in repair and reconstruction. Core variables for assessing and understanding economic recovery are identified from the literature, and approaches for measuring or estimating them are discussed. The paper concludes with important gaps in the development of a robust theory of economic recovery. Systematic data collection is needed to establish patterns and variations on how well and how quickly local economies recover from disasters. Research is urgently needed on the effectiveness of resilience approaches, decisions, and policies for recovery at both the business and local economy levels. Detailed, testable theoretical frameworks will be important for advancing understanding and developing sound recovery plans and policies. It will be especially important to consider the relationship between economic recovery and recovery of the built environment and sociopolitical fabric of communities in developing a comprehensive theory of disaster recovery.},\n",

    "abstract = {This paper explores the identification of leading indicators in aviation maintenance. Traditionally, improvements in aviation have been based on incident reporting and analyses and learning from failures. This traditional approach measures safety performance based on lagging indicators. However, there is a growing concern that this information does not provide the requisite information and insight to prevent future accidents. Resilience has been identified as the ability of the system to adjust prior, during and after a major mishap. This implies a need to recognize early signals to be able to anticipate and act properly. The objective of the paper is to understand leading indicators and the “why” behind the leading indicator as basis to look forward in monitoring safety performance. With regard to the leading indicator definition applied to aviation and maintenance in the context of resilience, we focus on learning from success and failures and propose: Leading indicators are precursors based on a model of safety implying a significant possibility of a subsequent event that has an impact on safety and performance. Leading indicators can therefore provide information about changes in risk before traditional risk analyses are able to capture this change},\n",

    "abstract = {Abstract. One strategy that systems employ to remain resilient in the face of shifting demands is the creation and maintenance of marginsof maneuver, cushions of potential actions and additional resources that allows the system to continue functioning despite unexpected demands. Systems are often comprised of units which have partial authority and autonomy to manage their individual margins of maneuver. In a study of emergency department interactions with other hospital units, we found that reorganizations to maintain margin could be classified into one of three categories: units could either defensively restrict the actions of other units or borrow margin from them, autonomously reorganize to create new margin, or cooperatively act with other units to exploit existing common pool resources and create new ones. The enumeration of the three classes of strategies to maintain margin of maneuver further explains how systems could reorganize themselves to remain resilient, and how they become brittle and fail. The influences on and interactions of each type of strategy are explored, and directions for future research to allow for better control of overall system margin, and hence resilience, are discussed.},\n",

    "abstract = {Embedded systems development creates a need of new design, verification and validation technics. Formal methods appear as a very interesting approach for embedded systems analysis, especially for dependability studies. The chosen formalism for this work is based on Colored Petri Net (CPN) for two main reasons: the expressivity and the formal nature. Also, they model easily the static and the dynamic natures of the studied systems. The main challenge of this work is to use existing models, which describe the system structure and/or behavior, to extract the dependability information in a most general case and failure diagnosis information in a particular case. The proposed approach is a CPN structural backward reachability analysis. It can be split into two parts. The first one is to perform the proposed analysis: inverse CPN. It is obtained thanks to structural transformations applied on the original CPN. The second part is the analysis implementation. This part needs some complementary concepts. Among them, the most important is the marking enhancement. The proposed approach is studied under two complementary aspects: algorithmic and theoretic aspects. The first one proposes transformations for the CPN inversion and the analysis implementation. The second aspect (the theoretical one) aims to offer a formal proof for the approach by applying two methods which are linear algebra and Linear Logic. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},\n",

    "abstract = {This article introduces a method for assessing health and safety management systems (MAHS) that has two innovative characteristics: (a) it brings together the three main auditing approaches to health and safety (HS) - the structural approach (which assesses the system prescribed), the operational approach (which assesses what is really happening on the shop-floor) and the performance approach (which assesses the results of performance indicators); (b) it emphasizes the resilience engineering perspective on HS, which takes into consideration four major principles (flexibility, learning, awareness, and top management commitment). Such principles underlie seven major assessment criteria, which in turn are divided into items (e.g. hazard identification from a resilience perspective is an item that belongs to the criteria of production processes). The items are sub-divided into statements, which are the requirements that should be assessed based on interviews, analysis of documents and direct observations. Within the 112 requirements proposed, 38 of them have clear links with at least one out of the four resilience engineering principles adopted. The remaining requirements are based on traditional assumptions underlying the so-called best practices of HS management. The results of the assessment for each item are expressed by a score on a scale of compliance with the established requirements, ranging from 0\\% to 100\\%. The specific score within that scale is obtained from tables used to assess applications for the Brazilian national quality award. The MAHS was tested in a case study that was carried out in a factory that manufactures automobile exhaust systems, located in Brazil. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},\n",

This is known as “destructive degradation.” Degradation tests are often accelerated by testing at higher than usual levels of accelerating variables like temperature.

Disruptions are often difficult to predict or may be potentially unavoidable. Systems able to survive and recover from disruption are referred to as resilient. In the case of mission critical systems, such as command and control systems, resilience is a necessary characteristic and must be considered early in the development cycle. This paper describes a quantitative approach to evaluating the expected resilience of a command and control system. The approach uses a Petri Net based executable model of the system architecture. The rigorous graph-theoretic and executable properties of Petri Nets are leveraged to support static and dynamic measures of the attributes of resilience. These measures are then combined into a holistic evaluation of resilience for the command and control system under study. The evaluation results can then be used to support selection among alternative candidate architectures and to identify areas for improvement in the selected architecture. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},\n",

The defects, made by nanoindentation and focused ion beam milling, are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). MEMS structures made of ultra-nano-crystalline-diamond (UNCD), a material developed at Argonne National Laboratory, were investigated using this methodology.
